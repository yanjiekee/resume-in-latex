\section{Summary}
A hardworking and motivated individual. I was awarded the Zepler Prize for having the top mark in Electrical \& Electronic Engineering Part I, 2018/19. Proficient with System Verilog, C, C++ programming languages as well as a number of simulation software. Keen on maths and have the tendency to be especially persistent when it comes to solving problems. It is my philosophy to truly understand the underlying principle of something that piques my interest.
