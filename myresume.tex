\begin{cvParagraph}
A hardworking and motivated individual. I was awarded the Zepler Prize for being the top of the 2019/20 academic year in grade average. Proficient with programming languages like System Verilog, C, C++ as well as some simulation software. Keen on maths and have the tendency to be especially persistent when it comes to solving problems. It is my philosophy to truly understand the underlying principle of something that piques my interest.
